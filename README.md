# Education with Augmented Reality using Vuforia
In this project, I have build Skeleton, Electric motor, Triceratops (SET) 3D models for Education with AR. The user can also interact with them, making it 4D AR application.

Tools used: Unity (IDE), Vuforia (SDK), Blender (3D modelling)

You can also run it in Android device by installing .apk file provided in 'Build' folder.

If you are a developer, you can download 'SET_developerPackage.unitypackage' and import it in your project. Must configure Vuforia before doing this.

Hope you like it ;)
