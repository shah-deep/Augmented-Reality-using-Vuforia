In this project, I have build Skeleton, Electric motor, Triceratops (SET) 3D models for Education with AR. The user can also interact with them, making it 4D AR application.

Tools used: Unity (IDE), Vuforia (plugin), Blender (3D modelling)

You can also run it in Android device by installing .apk file provided in 'Build' folder.
